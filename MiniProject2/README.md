## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms as part of Mini Project 2 for the Machine Learning course at KNTU University, taught by Dr. Aliyari. The algorithms covered include Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Perceptron, Decision Tree, and Bayes Algorithm. The project aims to provide a hands-on experience in understanding and applying these fundamental machine learning techniques.

## Algorithms

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.

### Perceptron
The Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data.

### Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label.

### Bayes Algorithm
Bayesian classification is a statistical classification method. It is based on Bayes' theorem. Naive Bayes classifiers assume that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

## Results
The results of the experiments including accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices are included in the respective Jupyter notebooks.
