## Introduction
This repository contains the mini project for the class taught by Dr. Aliyari at KNTU. The project addresses three main questions, focusing on binary classification and various least squares methods, including Fault Detection, Least Squares (LS), Recursive Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS).
## Project Overview
This mini project consists of three main tasks:
### 1)Binary Classification
### 2)Fault Detection
### 3)Least Squares Methods

## Question 1: Binary Classification
In this task, we develop a binary classification model to classify data into two categories. The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Question 2: Fault Detection
This task extends the binary classification model to detect faults in a given system. The model identifies whether a fault is present or not based on the input data. Performance metrics specific to fault detection, such as false positive rate and true positive rate, are analyzed.
## Question 3: Least Squares Methods
This task involves the implementation and comparison of three least squares methods:
### Least Squares (LS)
The basic form of least squares method is implemented to fit a linear model to the data by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values.

### Recursive Least Squares (RLS)
An extension of the LS method that updates the model parameters recursively as new data becomes available, making it suitable for real-time applications.

### Weighted Least Squares (WLS)
A variation of the LS method that accounts for heteroscedasticity in the data by assigning different weights to different observations, thus improving the model fit in such scenarios.
